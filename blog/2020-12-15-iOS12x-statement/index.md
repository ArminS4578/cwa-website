Apple now makes its Exposure Notification Framework available for the iOS 12.5 operating system version as well
<!-- overview -->

We are pleased that Apple has now made its Exposure Notification Framework available for the iOS 12.5 operating system. The company is accommodating the request to also enable users of the older iPhone models 5s and 6 to download tracing apps.
Deutsche Telekom and SAP are in contact with Apple to make the federal government's Corona warning app available for these models in the future. Transferring the Corona warning app to iOS 12.5 is possible, but requires work.
The companies are working diligently with Apple to make the necessary adjustments.
An exact date when the Corona warning app can be made available for download on iPhones 5s and 6 cannot be estimated at this time. The companies will share that information as soon as it is available.
The federal government's Corona warning app has been downloaded more than 24 million times to date.
